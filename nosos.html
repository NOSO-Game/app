                    <h2>Neeka</h2>
                    <p>A common cheerful NOSO™ which prefers land, although he can swim. Your first companion, he stays loyal to you as you go through the game. He has a low attack and defence but still loves to fight and is a reliable friend.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="card center flex">

                    <h2>Woso</h2>
                    <p>He may look frightening, however this common NOSO™ is harmless. This NOSO™ is the smallest NOSO™’s in the game, however he has a large personality and love to hide in corners.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="card center flex">

                    <h2>Forg</h2>
                    <p>This big common NOSO™ loves to fight and has a high attack. He may look very tough on the outside but he does like a bit of loving.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="card center flex">
                <img src="media/Characters/Powchee.png" class="thumbnail" />
                <div>
                    <h2>Powchee</h2>
                    <p>One of the rare NOSO™’s, this NOSO™ is quite quiet. He can do a good deal of harm and has a high defence so you do want to be careful around him, but if he is on your side, he is a good NOSO™ to have as he is one of the few NOSO™’s that lives in water.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="card center flex">
                <img src="media/Characters/Hober.png" class="thumbnail" />
                <div>
                    <h2>Hober</h2>
                    <p>He’s the NOSO™ that does what you don’t expect, the only flying NOSO™ in the game. This rare NOSO™ can hover over land and water as well as walking on land. With a very high defence he is hard to get, however he is very versatile.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="card center flex">
                <img src="media/Characters/Glob.png" class="thumbnail" />
                <div>
                    <h2>Glob</h2>
                    <p>Quite a clumsy NOSO™, this rare slimy NOSO™ is able to live on land or in water. He is a slow mover, but he is great at defending, with the highest defence in the game, due to his super thick skin.</p>
